Randomly generated shapes interpreted as letters by an OCR algorithm.

1. Removed ProcessingJS and now using only canvas to render the beziers
2. An alphabet is used to visualize all the letters that are created.
3. Using GSAP to animate the page and send the generated letters to their corresponding stack.
4. Browsing through stacks on click/tap on each 
5. Reworked the layout, now using Typekit to load a custom typeface (ff-meta-web-pro).
